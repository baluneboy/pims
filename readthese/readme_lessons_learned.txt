This is stupid to say, but when working from other people's code (hopefully, most of the time) you have to keep keen awareness
of namespace, especially when code you inherit declares global variables.  This can make code hard to read and keep track of
things.  When starting from scratch, see if you can do it without global (even though this can be very convenient).
